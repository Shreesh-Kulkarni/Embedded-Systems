A repository for all the codes and other course files of my Embedded Systems course.

The repo mainly consists of arduino and other microprocessor codes and their respective simulations/schematics in AutoDesk TinkerCAD and PICSimlab

Week4 contains simulations of the embedded operating system Contiki for wireless networks using Cooja and also calculations of their energy dissipiation and consumption.

*Note- The .brd files can only be accessed by Autodesk Eagle or Autodesk TinkerCAD*
