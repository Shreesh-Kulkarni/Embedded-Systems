A repository for all the codes and other course files of my Embedded Systems course.

The repo mainly consists of arduino and other microprocessor codes and their respective simulations/schematics in AutoDesk TinkerCAD and PICSimlab.
*Note- The .brd files can only be accessed by Autodesk Eagle or Autodesk TinkerCAD*
